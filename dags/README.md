# ML Pipeline Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed
The ML pipeline was experiencing multiple failures related to model loading, S3 connectivity, Slack notifications, and MLflow integration. The errors primarily manifested as:

1. 404 errors when attempting to download model files from S3
2. Failures in Slack notifications due to missing channels
3. Configuration issues with MLflow tracking URI

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Case-Sensitive Model Names in S3
- Updated `MODEL_CONFIG` in `config.py` to include proper case-sensitive filenames (`Model1.joblib` and `Model4.joblib`)
- Added a `file_name` property to explicitly specify the correct case-sensitive filename for each model
- Modified the model loading code to use the case-sensitive filenames from the configuration
- Successfully verified that both `Model1.joblib` and `Model4.joblib` exist in the S3 bucket

### 2. S3 Client Initialization and Error Handling
- Fixed the S3 client initialization in `storage.py` to use default credentials directly without complex dependencies
- Improved error handling for S3 operations with more descriptive error messages
- Restructured the download function with proper retry logic and progress tracking
- Enhanced validation of downloaded files to ensure they exist and have content

### 3. MLflow Integration with EC2 Endpoint
- Updated the MLflow tracking URI to point to the EC2 instance (`http://3.146.46.179:5000`)
- Modified MLflow client initialization for consistent connection to the tracking server
- Improved error handling for MLflow operations with graceful fallbacks
- Fixed experiment and run creation logic to ensure proper model tracking

### 4. Slack Dependency Removal and Logging Improvements
- Removed dependencies on Slack notifications which were failing due to missing channels
- Replaced Slack notifications with comprehensive logging
- Added detailed logging throughout the pipeline for better diagnostics
- Ensured log messages are clear and informative without emoji characters that may cause encoding issues

### 5. Syntax and Structure Fixes
- Corrected indentation and code structure in multiple files
- Fixed try/except blocks that were incorrectly nested or missing closing blocks
- Removed redundant code and simplified complex conditional logic
- Enhanced error propagation to maintain consistent error handling

## Testing and Verification
- Created a dedicated test script (`test_model_loading.py`) to verify model loading
- Successfully loaded both `Model1.joblib` and `Model4.joblib` from S3
- Confirmed MLflow tracking URI is correctly configured
- Verified proper error handling and logging throughout the pipeline

## Future Improvements
- Consider updating the XGBoost model serialization format for compatibility with newer versions
- Add unit tests for each component of the pipeline
- Implement more robust monitoring and alerting
- Create a dashboard for pipeline health metrics
