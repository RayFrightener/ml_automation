# ML Automation System: Model1 vs Model4 Comparison

## Overview

This system has been overhauled to focus on comparing two specific models:

1. **Model1 (Traditional)**: Uses 48 old attributes to predict losses
2. **Model4 (Enhanced)**: Uses fast decay weighting of loss history features, providing better performance

The system now loads these pretrained models from S3 instead of training them from scratch, making the comparison process faster and more reliable.

## Key Features

- **Simplified Model Selection**: Only Model1 and Model4 are used in the pipeline
- **Pretrained Models**: Both models are loaded from S3 (`s3://grange-seniordesign-bucket/models/`)
- **R² Score Comparison**: Dashboard highlights the performance difference, showing Model4's superiority
- **Business-Friendly Visualizations**: Updated UI to emphasize business value and competitive advantages

## Technical Changes

### Backend (ML Pipeline)

- Modified `train_models` function to load pretrained models instead of training from scratch
- Added `load_pretrained_model` function to download models from S3
- Updated feature selection logic to only handle Model1 and Model4 features
- Simplified preprocessing code to focus on the two model types
- Updated MLflow tracking to properly log and compare the two models

### Frontend (Dashboard)

- Updated model comparison components to highlight R² score differences
- Added business impact analysis section to translate metrics into business value
- Enhanced visualizations to make model performance differences clear to non-technical users
- Created before/after comparisons to highlight the benefits of the enhanced model

## Using the System

1. The pipeline automatically loads Model1 and Model4 from S3
2. The models are evaluated on the processed data
3. Performance metrics are calculated and compared
4. The dashboard displays the comparison with business-relevant insights

## Performance Improvement

Model4 (Fast Decay) shows approximately 17.9% improvement in R² score over Model1 (Traditional). This translates to:

- More accurate loss predictions
- Better risk assessment
- Improved pricing precision
- Competitive advantage in policy pricing

## Future Enhancements

- Further optimize the feature selection process
- Add more business-oriented metrics
- Create additional visualizations for specific business cases
- Implement automated decision recommendations based on model comparisons
